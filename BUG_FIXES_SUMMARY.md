# Bug Fixes Summary

This document details the 3 critical bugs found and fixed in the codebase.

## Bug #1: SQL Injection Vulnerability

**Location:** `data_processor.py`, line 14

**Description:** 
The `process_user_data` method was constructing SQL queries using string formatting (`f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"`), making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact:** 
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- Attackers could execute arbitrary SQL commands
- Potential for data theft, modification, or deletion
- Complete database compromise possible

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# After:
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
# In real implementation, use: cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

**Prevention:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when dealing with user input in SQL queries.

## Bug #2: Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Location:** `web_handler.py`, line 16

**Description:**
The `upload_file` function accepted user-provided filenames without validation, allowing path traversal attacks using sequences like `../`.

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** CRITICAL
- Attackers could write files to arbitrary locations
- System files could be overwritten
- Malicious code could be uploaded to web-accessible directories

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Before:
filename = file.filename
filepath = os.path.join('/uploads', filename)

# After:
from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename
filename = secure_filename(file.filename)
upload_dir = os.path.abspath('/uploads')
filepath = os.path.join(upload_dir, filename)

# Additional validation
if not os.path.abspath(filepath).startswith(upload_dir):
    return "Invalid filename", 400
```

**Prevention:** Always sanitize user-provided filenames and validate that file operations stay within intended directories.

## Bug #3: Division by Zero Error

**Location:** `data_processor.py`, line 33

**Description:**
The `calculate_statistics` method attempted to calculate mean by dividing by list length without checking if the list was empty.

**Impact:**
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- Application crashes with `ZeroDivisionError`
- Denial of service if error not handled
- Poor user experience

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added empty list check:
if not numbers:
    return {
        'mean': 0.0,
        'median': 0.0,
        'min': 0.0,
        'max': 0.0,
        'error': 'Empty list provided'
    }

# Also fixed median calculation for even-length lists:
if n % 2 == 0:
    median = (sorted_nums[n//2 - 1] + sorted_nums[n//2]) / 2
else:
    median = sorted_nums[n//2]
```

**Prevention:** Always validate input data and handle edge cases like empty collections.

## Additional Recommendations

While fixing these bugs, I noticed several other potential issues that should be addressed:

1. **Memory Leak** in `data_processor.py`: The cache grows infinitely. Consider implementing LRU cache or periodic cleanup.

2. **Weak Password Hashing** in `web_handler.py`: MD5 is cryptographically broken. Use bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing.

3. **XSS Vulnerability** in `web_handler.py`: The `show_user` function is vulnerable to XSS. Use proper template escaping.

4. **Predictable Session Tokens** in `web_handler.py`: Session IDs are predictable. Use cryptographically secure random tokens.

5. **No Error Handling** in `parse_json_data`: Add try-catch for JSON parsing errors.
